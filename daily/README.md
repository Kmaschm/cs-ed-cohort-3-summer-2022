# Daily Assignments
We'll use this section to post work throughout the sessions. This page will update daily with plans, links, etc. Associated code will be stored in the folder corresponding to the day. (If you reading this on github.com, look above to see these subdirectories.)

### Day 0 | Day 0b0000 | Day 0x00 : 6/29
Intros
- course
- instructors
- cohort
- program overview

Toolset
- slack
- repl.it
- CLI, javac, java

Lecture: Java basics/overview 
- tk

#### Work: Review pre-work
- __Note any observed best practices.__
- Bookmark locations of others' repos.
- Grow cohort KB ("knowledge base") on slack:
  - Have a Q? Ask.
  - Confident in your skills/knowledge? _See how well you can explain it._
- Small group sessions:
  - Discuss pre-work, explore one another's solutions.
  - Reconvene and present your team's cleanest solution / clearest explanation.
- DELIVERABLE:
  - Better version of each pre-work submission.
  - Cite any resources (human or other) you find helpful, as in-line comments.
  - Will be stored in your new work repo.

Your work repo should take on this structure:

### Day 1 | Day 0b0001 | Day 0x01 : 6/30

Demo: Starting a new coding assignment from scratch in repl.it

#### Work: Game of Nim
_GOAL:_

Be the player to remove the last stone.

_RULES:_
* bag contains 12 stones initially
* a move consists of removing 1-3 stones from the bag

_YOUR CODING MISSION:_

Write a program that will allow a human at console to play against your "AI" a game of NIM.
* prompt user for number of stones they wish to remove each turn
* tell user how many stones the AI removed and how many stones remain
* facilitate play until human or AI wins, and announce winner
- Grow cohort KB ("knowledge base") on slack:
  - Have a Q? Ask.
  - Confident in your skills/knowledge? _See how well you can explain it._

- SUGGESTED WORKFLOW:
  - Designate "slacker" to interact with slack. (esp. #java-fu and #replit-fu for now...)
  - Designate "driver" to screenshare and type.
  - All parties dialogue as you compose code.
  - Think about who you will designate as presenter, should you demo to entire cohort.

- PROTIPs:
  - Never stray far from _runnable code_.
  - Comments galore!!!
  
- DELIVERABLE:
  - Save in your_work_repo: `programming/1/Nim.java`
  - Include heading at top of file, as comment. List all collaborators and consultants. E.g.,
      ```java
      /**
       * Game of Nim by Team BossCoders
       * First Last
       * collaborators: First Last, First Last
       */
      ```

#### Lecture: Java basics, 1D arrays

new team formation...

#### Work: 1D Array Lab
