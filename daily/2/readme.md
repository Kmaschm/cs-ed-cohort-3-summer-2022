ArrayPractice assignment:

Take the starter code from this directory (the file named
ArrayPractice.java) and copy it to your repl.it repl. Place it in the
folder /programming/2 (you will have to make the 2 folder if you
haven't done so already).

Additional instrtuctions can be found in the ArrayPractice.java file.


Notes:
- Work with your breakout room - help each other.
- Make sure to sync your solution to GitHub when finished.
- Feel free to use repl.it's multi-player feature (the invite button) but if you do make sure everyone you work with copies all the code to their own repo.
- In your ArrayPractice.java file make sure to credit your partners. Specifically, add a comment above any function to tell us who you worked with, or if you got assistance, who from.
