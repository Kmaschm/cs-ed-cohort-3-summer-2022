- Grow cohort KB ("knowledge base") on slack:
  - Have a Q? Ask.
  - Confident in your skills/knowledge? _See how well you can explain it._

- SUGGESTED WORKFLOW:
  - Designate "slacker" to interact with slack. (esp. #java-fu and #replit-fu for now...)
  - Designate "driver" to screenshare and type.
  - All parties dialogue as you compose code.
  - Think about who you will designate as presenter, should you demo to entire cohort.

- PROTIPs:
  - Never stray far from _runnable code_.
  - Comments galore!!!
  
- DELIVERABLE:
  - Save in your_work_repo: `programming/1/Nim.java`
  - Include heading at top of file, as comment. List all collaborators and consultants. E.g.,
      ```java
      /**
       * Game of Nim by Team BossCoders
       * First Last
       * collaborators: First Last, First Last
       */
      ```
